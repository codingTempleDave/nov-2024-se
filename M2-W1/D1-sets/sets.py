"""
In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. 
It is defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor. 

Key Characteristics of Sets:
Unique Elements: A set automatically removes duplicate elements.
Unordered: The elements in a set do not have a defined order 
    and cannot be accessed by index.
Mutable: Sets themselves can be modified (adding or removing elements), 
    but the elements in a set are immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples).
    
Common uses: removing duplicates, checking memberships (emails, ips, usernames),
    tracking unique visits to a website, checking password against set of
    commonly used passwords, game inventories, etc

# Validation of Membership or Inclusion: 
# Is my group (heroes) a part of their group (fellowship)"
# Use issubset() to ensure that a smaller collection (heroes) 
# is fully satisfied by a larger collection (fellowship).
# Examples - graduation requirements | read/write permissions
print("\nAre all heroes in the fellowship?", heroes.issubset(fellowship))

# Containment or Ownership Testing
# Does my group (fellowship) contain their group (heroes)?
# Use issuperset() to confirm that one set (fellowship) 
# includes all elements of another (heroes)
# Examples - catalog of items | making sure a catalog contains all items
print("Does the fellowship contain all the heroes?", fellowship.issuperset(heroes))

"""
Summary Analogy:
issubset(): "Do my skills meet the job requirements?"
issuperset(): "Does my toolbox contain all the tools needed for the task?"
